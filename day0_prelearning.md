# Prelearning exercise

In this course, we will use R programming to analyze transcriptomics data, equipping you with the basic skills for state-of-the-art -omics analysis.

For this course, we expect students to have prior programming experience based on the courses completed during the BSc program. Because many students switch study programs or come from abroad, we know from experience that this is often not the case. Instead of making you wait for one year until you have completed all the requirements, we have developed a pre-learning task that will get everyone up to speed and able to follow the practical.

This pre-learning is a requirement for all students. This part of the course counts for 1 ECTS.

The task is to complete the sections 1-6 of the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). To do so, go to this website: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/. All instructions are there and well explained.

## Deadline
You need to complete this task before the in-person practical sessions starts.

## SETUP
Working through the book, you will work with the programming language called `R` in a program called `R Studio`. Ideally, you can install and run `R` on your computer (instructions in the book). If you do not manage to or have no computer (you can ask IT Services for the possibility to rent a computer) then you can also use an R Studio online version on the Galaxy website. To do so, follow these (instructions)[setup_GALAXY.md]. 

## Important! Deliverables
All students are required to complete this pre-learning task. The deliverable is an R script that contains the code of all examples and exercises in sections 1-6 by the deadline. Start with section 6 in the book, as this explains how to create R scripts. Make sure you run and understand all examples and exercises. Otherwise, it will be difficult the follow the practical.
